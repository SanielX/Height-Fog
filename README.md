# Height-Fog
 Height fog implementation for Unity. Work in progress
 # How to use
Like any Post Processing V2 shader. Add it as effect to Post Process volume.
Though it does not support transparent geometry (And won't do it by default)

### Todo:
* Custom shader support
* 3D Noise
* Color from directional light (Any light?)
